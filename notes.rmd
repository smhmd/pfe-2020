- For example fictitious stories will have grounds in something real whereas our real life can be somewhat staged from ideas brought to us by fiction.

# Description - Synopsis

- As (theater 2011) points out, the production has to be included if Caden wishes to portray his life realistically.

# Analysis

- The realism of the play starts threating the realism of Caden's life as they try discover what might happen if they did something differently (specifically, Tammy's suggestion).

    Postmodern angle: Cotard is played better than he can and is outperformed by his own doppelgänger. Caden is less real than his own creation.
    "He cannot capture any universal truths, no matter how much of the universe he has stuffed into his play project."
    Art is ultimately unsatisfying.

- Disappointment of Adele. Song for Caden. Theater being the place where Caden gets to voice his real self through Sammy.

- Sammy saying what Caden just thought is the copy overtaking the reality. Caden gets what he wants in that the play reveals things, but it's not to his advantage.

- Claire directs her speech to Sammy as a way to communicate with Caden. Postmodern, eh? Hyperreality and shit.

- Sammy being attracted to Hazel is the copy taking over. Hazel takes on Sammy to get to Caden, in return. Caden protests.

- Caden tries to kill himself over Hazel being in a relationship. Sammy does the same thing.

- Why did Caden not cast someone to save Sammy?

- Maria poisoned Olive through her tattoos that are killing her but also putting ideas in her head about her father's homosexuality and abandonment.

- A cynical, but original interpretation of the character Ellen is is that she was invented by Adele and Maria to justify Caden's disappearance from Olive's life to her. It was Adele who drew Caden as Ellen and who asked one of her neighbors to hand the -- YMS's gray and flower analysis and how Ellen is of Adele and Maria.

- As Caden goes in warehouse inside a warehouse, Madeline's books become sadder and realer. 4th layer of warehouse and deepest will ever see marks Madeline's "I don't feel well."

- CADEN Everyone's dreams in all those apartments.  All those secrets we'll never know.  That's the truth -- The film's message.

- German accent talking about autumn as “the beginning of the end.”

- 7:45 to 7:45 is evidence that Caden has been sleeping and having a dream.

- Caden saw Sammy as a projection of himself up until Sammy dies. Caden, then, allows for the possibility that Sammy had a life outside of his duties as Caden and thus, he explains that "none of those are extra..." -- "I know how to do the play now": A Part of Willy Loman in "Synecdoche, New York", 33

- Millicent removes Caden-lookalike from the stage saying "your scene is over," shifting the focus from Caden and his love affairs and giving voice to the pastor who successfully embodies the universality Caden has been wanting to achieve.

# Characters

Adele: carefree, bohemian
Madeline: professes in product placement.

# Criticism

- If you're gonna be ambitious and imbue your work with cryptic meanings that you have to decipher and pay close attention to and rewatch scenes and continue to reconsider and study it, you got to give people something. With The Matrix, it's bad ass fight scenes. With Synecdoche, they give you melancholy and despair because of your impending death. (a candy to let the broccoli go down a little bit easier.) What Synecdoche "gives" (for a mild watch) isn't a broad experience for a mainstream audience but the experience for playwrights, writers, and artists, where you are trying to build something beautiful to stave off the impending doom of death.

# Conclusion

- Should I discuss the film’s merits on a technical level? Should I address themes and how they are tackled via visual and narrative motifs? How much backstory should I present, or withhold? Should I focus on the unique structure of the film, which plays with our concept of time and how it is perceived as we age?

- I love this movie, watch it once or twice a year at least. It was incredibly depressing and haunting at first (well.. it still can be), but i find a lot of comfort in it now too. Synecdoche does a lot of things well, but for me it's particularly good at reminding me that my struggles aren't unique, and when i feel the most alone, the movie really helps me feel a sense of connectedness.
