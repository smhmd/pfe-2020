- postmodernism is hard to define

- Postmodernism is hard to define and is a set of rhetorical practices using a multitude of concepts such as differences, repetition, the trace, the simulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as presence, identity, historical profess, epistemic certainty, and the univocity of meaning.

- Habermas argues that postmodernism contradicts itself through self-refernce, and notes that postmodernists presuppose concepts they otherwise seek to undermine, e.g. freedom, subjectivity, or creativity.

- Postmodernism is a rhetorical application of strategies employed by avant-garde of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, an avant-garde that made possible by modernity separating artistic values from science and politics in the first place.

- Kant's Copernican revolution: We cannot know things in themselves and that objects of knowledge must conform to out faculties of representation, creating truths of fact and truths of , which kick-started the analytic/continental division in philosophy.

- I would argue that a postmodern film would inevitably have modern shell to house the inconsitencies and be commertially viable.

- The real is which can be simulated, xeroxed, and copied. A holograph of a body (Paul Alan, 2 Pac, Zappa); Intercourse, through pornography or virtual reality with a ideal, rendering intimate relations technological and simulate-able.

- kid screaming at a video game. parent from a different modern reality that doesn't involve screaming at machines. Why not scream at machine?

- Orange Clockwork: blood is more real in film than it is in the world.

# Description - Synopsis
- The movie has avant-garde aspects that reference reality (art imitates life) and map directly to it. The protangonist's first name: Caden, is a clear ....

- everyone's death in Synecdoche is brutal

- Summarizing Synecdoche without threading into analysis is quiet challenging as some scenes transform the plot under examination.

- As (theater 2011) points out, the production has to be included if Caden wishes to portray his life realistically.

- It's been described as a writer's wet dream with references to playwrights and novelists.

- Cinematography: Every place is like a painting.

# Analysis
- https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stages+of+life%3A+art%2C+time+and+meaning+in+Synecdoche%2C+New+York.-a0459986520 Kaufman cares about titles.

- Descartes notes that a wax could be turned into a liquid but we would still think it's the same thing relying on reason rather than empiricism.

- A hammer existence doesn't make sense without nails, tables, chairs, and wood. Likewise, Caden's life started to lose meaning the more he loses key people in his life.

- Caden's play doesn't have a title.

- People appreciate Caden's play, but those most close to him don't.

- Disappointment of Adele. Song for Caden. Theater being the place where Caden gets to voice his real self through Sammy.

# Criticism
- Caden and Hazel returning to Syne.. their city for Hazel to die in the fire is a bit of annoyance.

- If you're gonna be ambitious and imbue your work with cryptic meanings that you have to decipher and pay close attention to and rewatch scenes and continue to reconsider and study it, you got to give people something. With The Matrix, it's bad ass fight scenes. With Synecdoche, they give you melancholy and despair because of your impending death. (a candy to let the broccoli go down a little bit easier.) What Synecdoche "gives" (for a mild watch) isn't a broad experience for a mainstream audience but the experience for playwrights, writers, and artists, where you are trying to build something beautiful to stave off the impending doom of death.

# Conclusion
- Should I discuss the filmâ€™s merits on a technical level? Should I address themes and how they are tackled via visual and narrative motifs? How much backstory should I present, or withhold? Should I focus on the unique structure of the film, which plays with our concept of time and how it is perceived as we age?
