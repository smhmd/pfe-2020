# Introduction

| After its release in 2008 with a running time of 124 minutes, Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, _Synecdoche, New York_, ignited an ambivalent range of reviews. As The Observer's own Rex Reed writes: "no matter how bad you think the worst movie ever made ever was, you have not seen _Synecdoche, New York_."^[See @reed_2008.], Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert declares _Synecdoche_ film of the decade ^[See @ebert_2009.]. The film has been described as "beautifully realised," ^[See @baughan_2009.] "frustrating," ^[See @johnson_2008] and "achingly, achingly sad"^[See @chocano_2008] by critics. It has garnered a critics score of 68% and an audience score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes ^[The critics score is also known as Tomatometer. @rotten_tomatoes.], which illustrates a degree of polarization, perhaps best summarized in Peter Bradshaw's review^[See @bradshaw_2009.], where he states: "The film is either a masterpiece or a massively dysfunctional act of self-indulgence and self-laceration."
|    The film follows theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Obesessed with his own mortality, Caden's wife Adele (Catherine Keener) leaves him to pursue a painting career in Berlin, taking their daughter Olive (Sadie Goldstein) with her. Caden, then, recieves a MacArthur Fellowship which he intends to use to create "something big and true and tough" and "finally put [his] real self into something." , which, in turn, develops into a physically impossible, mind-bending creation, where they fit a flying zeppelin in a warehouse, and have actors playing actors playing actors.
|    The movie explores themes such as time, existentialism, solipsism, etc. However, the most prominent theme in the movie is death, even though the movie itself would disagree as Sammy, Caden's own doppelg√§nger, affirm that "This is not a play about dating. It's about death", to which Caden replies: "It is a play about dating. It's not a play just about death. It's about everything. Dating, birth, death, life, family. All that."
